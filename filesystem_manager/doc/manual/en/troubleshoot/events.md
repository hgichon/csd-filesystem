# Diagnosing Event Warning

> You can check the event history of the cluster manager to verify various logs of events and processes occurred from the system.  
> When an event is detected from "[1.4.2 Task Status](###cluster.xhtml#1.4.2 Task Status)", you may take action by following the guide below.  
> The warnings and error messages can be displayed by the user's intention and it is recommended to check using the guide on whether the message is generated by the intention or the actual error.

## NIC eth(x) state is down

| Analysis     | Description   |
| ------        | -----  |
| Severity        | High   |
| Event   | The network connection of the cluster node is not working properly. |
| Version     | All  |
| Cause     | It usually occurs when the node's NIC is physically damaged or the cable is dislocated and also often happens when an error occurs on the NIC kernel driver.  |
| **Related Issue** | It might cause a system failure when the network using the NIC has no redundancy. |
| Solution     | Replace the part that is causing the trouble. |

## NIC bond(0|1) is degraded

| Analysis     | Description      |
| ------        | -----  |
| Severity        | Middle   |
| Event          | The storage or the service network connection of the cluster node is in degradation. |
| Version     | All  |
| Cause     | It usually occurs when one of the redundant NIC of the node is physically damaged or the cable is dislocated and also often happens when an error occurs on the NIC kernel driver. |
| **Related Issue** | It would not affect the service, however, it requires an action. |
| Solution     | Replace the part that is causing the trouble. |

## NIC eth4 does not use maximum speed link (link speed: xxx Mb/s),

| Analysis     | Description      |
| ------        | -----  |
| Severity        | Middle   |
| Event          | The network connection of the cluster node is not configured for a full performance. |
| Version     | All  |
| Cause     | It mostly happens when a NIC of the node fails the auto-negotiation with the switch, or when it has a physical problem, or when the cable connection is unstable. It occasionally happens when an error occurs on the NIC kernel driver. |
| **Related Issue** | It would not affect the service, however, it requires an action due to the possible performance loss. |
| Solution     | Replace the part that is causing the trouble. |

## OSDISK_HIGH: VolGroup-lv_root

| Analysis     | Description      |
| ------        | -----  |
| Severity        | High   |
| Event          | The availability of the OS disk went below 20%. |
| Version     | All  |
| Cause     | It happens in cases when the debug level is too high, when the custom package is installed, and when there is a log overload due to the system software error.   |
| **Related Issue** | When the OS disk lack space, some of the system configuration file and disk buffer might not function properly and will cause a failure on connecting new service client or the malfunction of the monitoring software. |
| Solution     |  You should delete unnecessary files to secure the OS disk space. <br> Check the usage of each directory through the command below and delete the unnecessary files. |

1. Access the system console using SSH and use the "df" command to verify the actual OS disk availability.

```
$ df -h /
Filesystem            		Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/mapper/VolGroup-lv_root 	50G  48G   2G   96% 	/

$ cd / ; du -sh `ls | egrep -v 'proc|sys|export|volume'`
... Omitted ...
196M    opt
617M    root
1.4G    usr
40G    var
... Omitted ...
```

2. Check the capacity of the major log directories of AnyStor-E.

```
$ cd /var/log;  du -sh `ls`
... Omitted ...
1.3G    /var/log/gsm
374M    /var/log/gms
1.8G    /var/log/glusterfs
... Omitted ...
```

3. Look for old log files from the directories and delete them.

```
$ ls -alt /var/log/gsm/

644M    /var/log/gsm/publisher.log-20171109.gz
656M    /var/log/gsm/publisher.log-20171111.gz
628M    /var/log/gsm/publisher.log-20171113.gz
648M    /var/log/gsm/publisher.log-20171115.gz

$ rm -rf /var/log/gsm/publisher.log-20171028.gz
```

4. Check whether the OS disk space is secured.

```
$ df -h /
Filesystem            		Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/mapper/VolGroup-lv_root 	50G  24G   26G   48% 	/
```
